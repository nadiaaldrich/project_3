## How does it work?

Options | Description
------------ | -------------
**Option 1** | User can select from pre-set images to test the mask detector.
**Option 2** | User can upload an image to run the mask detector.
**Option 3** | User can initiate the webcam feature and use the mask detector LIVE--in real time!
